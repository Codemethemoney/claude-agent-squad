# Claude Agent Squad - Project Overview

## Project Vision

Claude Agent Squad is a sophisticated multi-agent orchestration system that leverages semantic engineering principles to create, manage, and coordinate AI agents for complex workflows. The system integrates with Claude Desktop through MCP (Model Context Protocol) and provides a powerful framework for building AI-powered automation.

## Core Concepts

### 1. **Agents**
- Autonomous AI entities with specific roles and goals
- Each agent has specialized tools and capabilities
- Agents can collaborate and delegate tasks

### 2. **Jump Codes**
- Rapid command system for agent and task management
- Format: `@command:param1=value1,param2=value2`
- Aliases and shortcuts for common operations
- Macro support for complex workflows

### 3. **Orchestration**
- Intelligent task routing and execution
- Sequential and parallel workflow support
- State management and checkpointing
- Error handling and recovery

### 4. **Semantic Engineering**
- Context-aware agent creation
- Dynamic capability assignment
- Natural language task interpretation
- Adaptive workflow optimization

## Key Features

### 1. **Dynamic Agent Generation**
- AI-powered spec generation
- Template-based agent creation
- Custom role definition
- Automatic tool assignment

### 2. **Intelligent Task Routing**
- Supervisor agent for task distribution
- Capability-based assignment
- Load balancing
- Priority queue management

### 3. **Robust Error Handling**
- Retry mechanisms
- Graceful degradation
- Error recovery workflows
- Detailed logging and debugging

### 4. **Extensible Architecture**
- Plugin system for new agents
- Custom tool integration
- Workflow templates
- Macro system for automation

## Development Philosophy

### 1. **Sequential Knowledge Building**
- Each phase builds on previous work
- Clear dependencies and prerequisites
- Incremental complexity
- Comprehensive testing at each stage

### 2. **Semantic Design Principles**
- Natural language interfaces
- Intuitive command structures
- Context-aware operations
- Self-documenting code

### 3. **Production-Ready Focus**
- Enterprise-grade error handling
- Performance optimization
- Scalability considerations
- Security best practices

## Quick Start Guide

### Basic Commands
```bash
# Initialize the system
@init

# Create an agent
@create_agent:role=developer,goal=write clean code

# Assign a task
@assign_task:agent=developer,task=implement user authentication

# Run workflow
@run_workflow:workflow=development

# Check status
@status
```

### Using Macros
```bash
# Execute a predefined macro
!quick_review(task_description=Review PR #123)

# Define a custom macro
@define_macro:name=deploy,sequence=[@test,@build,@push]
```

### Sequential Execution
```bash
# Execute multiple commands in sequence
@@create_agent:role=tester @@assign_task:agent=tester,task=run tests @@run_workflow
```

## Success Metrics

1. **Agent Performance**
   - Task completion rate
   - Error rate < 5%
   - Average response time < 2s

2. **System Reliability**
   - Uptime > 99.9%
   - Successful recovery rate > 95%
   - Data integrity 100%

3. **Developer Experience**
   - Command memorability
   - Documentation completeness
   - API consistency

## Next Steps

1. Review architecture documentation in `01_architecture/`
2. Follow development phases in `02_development_phases/`
3. Explore agent templates in `03_agent_templates/`
4. Learn task sequences in `04_task_sequences/`
5. Master jump codes in `05_jump_codes/`
